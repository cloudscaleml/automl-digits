# automl-digits

In this lab you will create an automated machine learning model. The same MNIST dataset of handwritten digit classification  will be used. You can create a model with Automated Machine Learning from either the Jupyter notebook experience or the Azure Portal Machine Learning UI.

## What is Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)
Automated machine learning, also referred to as automated ML, is the process of automating the time consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development. It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality.
